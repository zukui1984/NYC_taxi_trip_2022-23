# NYC Green & Yellow Taxi Trip 2022-2023
Yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. Dataset source - [LINK](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)

## Important Points
* Using *.parquet* dataset of yellow and green taxi from **2022-2023** 
* Data structure isn't always same with other years eg. these aren't included *pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, and dropoff_latitude*
* As I don't own Power BI business account - there are **some limitation** with Desktop version incl doing data cleaning
